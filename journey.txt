cracks of universe:-
-->youtube taught everything, without youtube i dont understand a single word,if there is no youtube specifically no tutorials,than no,one gives a shit

-->binary language is mystery opener,NN mimics any logic Gate

-->in this world , where 9.9999% things are unpredicted, How can u predict even your destiny or fate by doing some foolish thing-(1) like:- preparing for something and keep having a hope that someday i crack that paper. 
         In this universe almost all human being have hope on something that he is regularly investing the time. And this is one of most foolishiest things to do-(2), 
hence by (1)&(2) we can d=say that All humans are foolish

-->in this universe where we come and go with empty hands, How can we gain something physically in our life,
Eg - we born, eat food and drink water take energy from thesun, grow in a space ,become big,we died,become soil .
     We can never ever gain or loose someting physcally like, happyness,wealth etc,. We only gain or loose something mentally gaining is secrets of universe loosing is my ego  

-->why is the python used for ML whereas c++ is more fast in doing calculatiions

-->dont use your conciesness while working with an iterative task e.g Typing, focus on the letters that reflects on screen, to get fast and accurate typing result

-->if u face any hard problem(logical or emotional),Search for same type of problem in nature or in simple problems, HOLLA! you find the solution.
-->simple programming strictly check "or" conditions of goal tree and  always prevent unnecessary execution of "or" branches, AI whereas check all "or" and findout itself which "or" is right for it.

-->go in past virtually to become good in everything

--> to train your mind do what you hate to do in particular field, e.g-> debugging big code of c++

-->i konw i m not strong as you but i know one thing if u compete with me only two possible states are there either you loose, or i died in the field

-->god never clear the path or way or your thought.... he always try to confuse you... if he tell u 100% than he also put little doubt on that by some sort of unnatural behaviours. it is upto you that u judge that this is 100% thing and this is that unnatural thing that god just gave to confuse me
Eg  - CP really helps to get the job, but in one video take u forward's striver give a bold statement that without CP whatever he can achieve being from a tier 3 college he also manage to get the same. Oh come on in one video he says that CP is the cause of his present achievements and now he say that without CP it is possible for him (may be it is not correct eg.. bhagwaan agar galti se bata de poori baat to baad me tumhe cofuse karne k liye kuch atpata karta h hamesha...)
BUTTTTT!!! if god speak u the truth than no stopper in this univ can stop u, u become like a lightning.


--> eat and sleep are only a necesity of the "body". eat and sleep have nothing to do with your own i.e "ego's" need. If Your body wants to eat it says to you, not u says to it that " lets eat/sleep something/sometime ".  So take body's eat and sleep as a natural phenomenon not your own requirements. (khaana kane neend dawai saai le, jaali chahindi taali apu leni tu, tu ni bolna kadi ki chaal khaaande ya sonde)

--> padhai m jab bhi m kuch mushkil sa kar raha hota hu m hamesha khud ki ki hui cheezon ko shaq k nazarie se dekhta tha ki kahin m galat to nhi kar raha par aaj pata chala shaq or bharosa tu karta kispe tha?
saara khel to bhagwaan ka hota tha tu to bass machine hoti thi, operator to khud bhagwaan hota h.... To vishwaas rakh bass ki jo bhi karenge wo bhagwaan sahi hi karenge. Agar mere goal m itni paavanta h to bhagwaan avashya mera saath denge. "God is always codding the"


-->U can attain any intelectual property by vishwaas. E.g. if i believe in CP than its guarenteed that i gain CP.
	vishwaas is 1. ur vishwaas in that thing u want and 2. ur ignorance of other things.
	if u get these 2 points checked than i am the god who is telling "i bet you than no creature in this world break this believe law"
	
-->jo cheez tukka & feedback (trial and error) se seekhi ho wo kabhi nhi bhoolti
jaise typing me m ^ ki position bhoolta tha, jab mein use aankh se dekhta tha ki haan 6 par ^ h,
to m hamesha bhool jaata tha lekin ab meine use feedback se dekha pehle kuch tukke maare than dekha ki kon sa tukka sahi h.... or ferr by magic jab koi tukka theek nikal gaya than wo tukke ki position meri memory m jaise chapp si gayi ki 6 par hi ^ h

-->ish upnishad says that jo log sirf nashwar sansaar ko bhogne m lage rehte h wo andhkar m girte hein, aur jo log sirf anaswar sansar ki jigyaasa m leen rehte hein wo b usi andhakar m girte hein.
to sahi yhi h ki tum pehle iss duniya m kuch bada karo ferr anashwar sansaar k baare m socho

my life is different from any other!..
 i know u thinking that everyone think that their life is unique but , in my case it is really very very bizzare. Let's for a second think that some noise like a "eeennnnnnn.." always surround your ears, whle u are awake u feel like all things are just an illusion, think if u just think that u r not hurt or u not feel any pain anger happiness at the time, than  u rally start forgetting all pain, emotion, suffering, even happiness at the time. Huh.. these all are sines that i must have to visit a psychaitrist but this must be a possibility that i am somewhere not mad but who thinks that these was sines of a mad person are "real mad".

this universe take 10000000000.. years to be exist at this moment or i can say that we take 1000000.. years in this whole universe to take birth,to be here at this planet. And this 1000000.. years might take series of simultaneous events to be happen, and suppose in these humoungosly large number of simultanous events , if a small smaller smallest possible event is simply doesn't happen or say happens but happens wrongly than what is the probability that than after same number of simultanous events "here we exist", or we can say that earth exists or simply we can say thing which we call the "life" exists.

   yesterday i decided to wake up early but due to that DJ in shiva's home i slept at 12:30 am and not ve able to wake up at 3:00 am. So i wake up at 7 and solve CPP level order and than overview that NN part than i experience a very unique feeling, a simple notingness in me while hearing osho.Ohh... I forget to tell u that i met osho around 3-4 months before , back then i am ready to take the "gyaan" from osho but didn't know why i not able to hear him i think that osho's education is not of that genre which i want so, i not follow osho 3-4 months ago, yesterdat night a thing happen while i hearing the osho osho once said "krishan ki geeta to m bahar sabko sikhata hu, bheed bhaad m, Lekin tum chand logon ko m asli gyaan de raha hu or wo h "ashtawakra geeta" ".
Today i also face a truth that in this physical world , physical tricks are there in the name of "10 mahavidhiyan" of hindu devi's and one i require is called "nil tara" devi which have power of 1000 saraswati matas. But i refused it because a sound in me says to me that , "is it that what u want?" than i say no to mahavidhis and yes to ashtavakra gita to attain my new dream "bharat ko jagana".For this i want a strong
 point(skill/speciality) in me through which people start hearing my voice 

11/2
   i again wasted 90 days in my mind's presence. From october mid i start 3 things, than after 2 months in January,i fail to continue those 3 things and left one thing i.e ML.Than in january's end ileft one more thing i.e DEVELOPEMENT. But i fail to continue my routine and CP also diminished.1 month feel like one day. Now i really want to give last try to CODDING, if this time i got failed in it, than i left CODDING,its a promise to myself......... New plan is being planned by amit on earth.

9/3
   now i wasted my 120 datys by doing nothing, but a small hope is opened for me that anubhav is coming.
if he comes, we both do competetive programming and become best codders in the world.

if he'll not come than i dont waste even a single day.

	yesterday i have a dream in dream, In my dream I m sleeping with mummy. While sleeping in my dream, i have a dream that i went "pul k paar waala service station" to hot my water and then i came back to home, in the way silu's child saurab's wedding is take place. When i come to my home , the gate is locked from inside than "mein mami ko zor zor se aawaaz lagane laga", she was sleeping inside my house with me (and i dreamt this current situation in that sleep), she awake and see that suddenly i m not sleeping with her and shouting mumma, mumma outside the gate. My mom is amazed, that how i get outside the locked gate and lock it from inside..... it is very scary/creepy feeling


8/6
	i am fast enough for typing and i am learning python and graphs. I see the improvement in mine, all thanks to krishna ji and shivji.

9/6
	we simply do 5 + 3 = 8. But we dont see from 5pm to make 8pm, we start counting from 0->1->2->3 for 5pm->6pm->7pm->8pm. Thats just amazing because for normal people, we start counting from 1,2,3,...
but in the hood we make 0,1,2,3.....

20/6
	today after many days i think i do something, i solve around 20 star pattern questions in one day. I also do things according to time table today, and make time table for tommorrow also. Today i see a improvement in my typing speed also.  


23/6
	i have a 3 level dream. 
First is kind of a lucid dreaming, in the end of this first dream i found that i am dreaming, this is not true. A burning bus comes flying from valley side of ukhli and fall on plain land in backyard of gudru's home. Bus is full of burning passangers. This all happens in front of me so i take some photos of it, than during eating i show these photos to mom but, photos aren't of burning bus that my phone captured, these photos are of other things. Than i find that i take of photos of bus and photos are of other trivial things. So, I found that i am dreaming. Than i became afraid of stuck at this dream so i perform my DREAM BREAK action very hardly. And dream breaks.
I awake in 2nd dream in which i slept opposite side of bed from reality and my vision is bad seems like that i do DREAM BREAKING action vary hard and my eyes gets hurt. My mom awakes and say " now i am awake so i go to bathroom " i also awake and see my face in mirror than i find my pupil edges are blooded and i get frightened and my dream breaks another time 
3rd time i awake in same situation as reality but i guess that it was also a dream and than i get awake of that 3rd dream also. And this time i awake in reality.... 
i was very frightened

	today i m going to start a new journey. This jorney is little bit different than older once, this time i have 
	1. ans to why
	2. plan to execute
	3. self-belief
	ans to why is, i want to change the thinking of people of atleast india or america about life, and i dont know why i think that me and acharya prashant have to unite. Ofcourse acharya prashant wants a head who never fear from hard-work and never bend down in front of normal people. So, i have to proove him that i am the one who they(AP) want. I make him believe that due to his guidence i able to succed in CP and my career and my life and even in my personal matters. BY showing him my achievements i win his heart and he join me in changing the minds of all people towards satya.

	plan to execute, is that i first ace CP(5JUL20-5JUL22) than by acing CP i give a lot of competetions and i grab an oportunity to work in any of the "tough working and highly paid indian product based companies".Than by that experience i get an senior position at one of the USA'proud companies than i work very hard there and show my gratitude towards the "benefit of company by sending me in USA" and than i pack my bag to USA. There i work very hard to get promoted to staff engineer as soon as possible. Thus by spending atlest 6-7 years in USA i returen back to india and meet & thank AP. From there i do social work of the "ans to why" thng than after some time i return to my already buyed house and agricultural land in UPPER-HIMACHAL and there I live in Peace with mother nature and my mother KAMLA dDEVI

	self-belief comes inside me actually by "jalan" of seeing that foolish people who do only DEV get respect by doing just DEV whereas i tried so hard but nothing worked out for me. There was a problem in my BOW-MY-SELF. i am not fully dedicated to what i do. So i decided to fully dedicate my sleep,time-pass,Procastination to "THE CP", in the name of my father because i was dumb all the time, My father is gone for almost 4 years now, But i have not feelings towards him, because if i have little bit of feelings for him, than i am not so happy and comfortable with my current situation, i act like nothing is changed from his death,
	I leave my Mom alone 2 times, I never help her in shop with my sole. I never had feelings of love with my father's sign i.e. the shop....
So I agreed to PROVISION offered by my beloved shiv ji
he has offered me:
	>my small house on hills
	>my agricultural land in hills
	>stout bank balance in my bank account
	>stout money for trading
	>ukhli home whole makeover
	>big car capable of transporting my whole family
	>good ego devoit respect 
	>respectful meeting with acharya prashant ji
	>chance to work on most advanced technology & companies in world
	and may more...  for jsut ghaur tapasya which is comparably greater than that of a IAS aspirant

11/7 
	>i am now little more disciplined than past me. I now able to controll my minds some dicisions like eating, studying, even msturbaion, to say no to these desires while my mind continuosly want these.
	>we figure out a better financial planning which gives all my fee and even give me 2 lac rs. in return when i complete my btech.

21/7
	>around 3 days before i was completely broke because during my first codeforces contest i score 397 points. At the last minute i solve 1st Q and gain 397.
	>than i decide to grind problems difficulty-wise, as a dead set.
	>and today i m goig to make a streak of 20 problems in a day.

28/7 
	after achieving 6.5 problems per day speed now i set new goals i figure out my routines and goals:-

	morning : CF Grind
	evening : UVA problem ^ dev

	-i start watching movies for entertainment when i became comfortable with my daily routine.
        -from now on i only touch-type and put my focus on accuracy not on speed.
	-i completed almost 50 problems of difficulty 800 on codeforces and from tommorrow i solve 900 - 1000 difficulty problems.
	-i sidewise start learning about quantum physics in my free time.
	-if i get continous 2hr free time in afternoon than i prefer sleep over entertainment.

	>goals
		Personal: waking up early everday.
		Educational: quantum machanics starting in free time
		CP: completing complete search as fast as possible & achiving 10 medium problems per day speed

30/7 
	>first time in life i able to learn from a textbook. For starting divide and conquer i have to study binary search, for that i choose to learn from CP3 book where i solve a problem for finding best installment ammount for a given loan, intrest and month. I think god has oppened the door for me for reading from books.
		

5/8	
	>today is my 6th-7th day of noFap and i feel much energized than before. I continue my noFap upto 2nd review (can be break on special occasions)
	>i start my real practicing of 900 - 1000 difficulty problems and react in dev also
 	>next vow is to "dont overthink unnecessary things", also to "eat less on nights and early mornings".

13/8, 
	>today my favourite phone died. He also gave me a learning that, for overcoming silly mistakes(laaparwaahi) always think of the worst case scenerios of thing u r doing. e.g-> picking my phone in the pocket that already full with my wallet, playing with a cim card may lead to lost that cim card while playing, while modifying the index var it is possible that it might get over-range i.e its value become bigger than n-1 or smaller than 0.
	>for solving a problem first u think all possible solution. It doesn't matter how silly or difficult that solution is( it may be an o(n^n) solution). Than choose the best one. If you put a constraint on your mind in starting that "solution must be feasible" than your mind doesn't give you magical ans or solutions.
	>for lazyness always keep it in mind that thing which gave u joy at current stage always get replaced by your next activity. Not any joy in this univ is permanent. if u are sleeping in early morning u think that sleeping is think that give u joy at that moment, but it is guarantees that if u wake up and start working that sleep's joy is not joy anymore
	>for Procastination of stupid things like to go for learning license to hamirpur  can be done by the motivation of that feeling when u complete task and feel less weighted


23/8
	> i solve a math heavy Question on my own yesterday but i also stuck on a implementation Question yesterday which keep on scaring me.
	> i also thought that in worst case i still have 2 years of time with me i.e. approx 700 days i.e approx 100 week of time which is enough for being a candidate master or even a master in codeforces
	> i find that my mind is easy on difficult problem but stuck always on easy problems, and that "H and V" Question also tell me the truth that my implementation part is not upto the mark, So, for the next one-two months i solve that kenko's Question and after that i give the virtual rounds on codeforces, because there is no benefit of giving the div2 viirtual rounds witt a week implementation, So my goal is to build my implementation diamond sharp by practicing that kenkoo's questions.
	> i got that pdf made by a red codder and i found that pdf is very helpful nowon i rigourasly follow steps on that pdf.
	> Recurssion, Recurssion, Reccursion is my new friend boz of its versitality. It is an important part in basic implementation and it also have its own place in advance topic like BackTracking and all time favourite, dynamic programing.
	> i find that motivating punjabi song which is "rabb kenda thodi der hot ther jaa", which is resting in my old phone's memory, dekha jaaye to agar mera phone paani m na doobta to mujhe y song yaad to kabhi aana hi nahi tha, phone dooba bhagwaan ki kripa se, gionee on hua bhagwaan ki  kripa se (iski battery hi nhi chalti thi, daddu charger se on hua tha y), to matlab wo song bhi bhagwaan ka hi diya h mere khaatir, wo line to mujhe badi pasand h ki "aaj_hi_likhna h"

19/9
	> 5-6 days ago anubhav came again and i feel guilty for him that i left him alone so i again decided to help him for breaking this loop. he went okay for 1 day and again started to glitching and than i give him the gyaan of everything i.e gyaan of vishwaas which goes like this.
	U can attain any intelectual property by vishwaas. E.g. if i believe in CP than its guarenteed that i gain CP.
	vishwaas is 1. ur vishwaas in that thing u want and 2. ur ignorance of other things.
	if u get these 2 points checked than i am the god who is telling "i bet you than no creature in this world break this believe law"
	> GOD told me to do this now nothing can stop me in chirping CP,CP everytime.
	> from now onwards i make a vow that nothing can come in my way for attaining CP, Neither sleep, low energy, mood etc nor entertainment and my mother.
	>when i am in good mood:  virtual contest
	  not in that good mood:   practice
		          tired:  reading, planing etc

	>baat to sahi hai, itne din ho gye meine kabhi CP m gote nhi lagaye aur acharya ji bolte hai jab tak gote nhi lagenge tab tak mukti nahi milegi. So, it is the time when i have to start diving into CP for salvation/ redemption from CP.
	>mujhe journey m kayin step lene padenge aur CP/dev unme se ek hi h. For E.g> stock market, tax saving, confidence boosting, entrepreneurship etc. Ho jaayega sab chinnta na kar. Bas y yaad rakh ki ONE_STEP_AT_TIME_MAY_BE_TWO_MILES_AT_A_LINE. To sutra yhi h ki ek time me sirf ek cheez ke baare me hi socho, multitasking se bacho.

So, i think i m a person who can't focus on one thing..
So, as a result of all these experiences i now mix and match practice also..

1/12 :
almost a year i wasted only utilize 25% of the year....
But Now i decide if not this tym than there is not other time..
visualize every second of time as ...only this time i got for myself warna poore din m uss factory m kaam karte karte toot jaata hu yhi tym mila h mujhe apni zindagi badalne ka ... 
i cannot waste it.. aage jo hoga dekha jaayega... But this time i do my best... CM banna hai to BC banna hai ab to typing bhi fast ho gyi hai...
CM banna chahta hai?--nahi
to kya?--dukaan
to padne ka naatak?--sorry for that

okay i promissed to myself that i never ever force it to do CS job if it doesn't suit me...OK?--thaiin god

its like a rollercoaster ride. Levels.fyi keep my dream alive thanks to it..
I am completely broke. Smoke a full joint with my childhood freind Gappu. This joint reminds me my first joint.. I smoke that joint with full enjoyment and enthusiasm.
What i do now! Please tell me lord shiva What i smoke now... Joint feels like nothing to me. All joy goes out! Please Lord shiva tell me what i do now?
I failed my mom, dad, sisters, and all others who have hope for me.
CP -> i like you but it seems like doing nothing for the world..
DEV -> I have fear of it. That it also failed me.
Other Gov Test... > sorry I can not prepare for you.

Now what, Only one Option_Hope_Gaol now i.e Dev
isn't it?

19/12
	Yes U are right, DEV is everything for material life.
	After hard 11 days. There are certain awakening cum changes are in me.

>biggest is that now i am open for leaving the home, i am ready to face challenges of the life in the real world. Unlike my brother (neetu and sandeep) who refused to leave home when there chance come.
I am ready to leave my home when my chance come.

>Cetain goal clarities in my mind. First what to do now. Although dev is important But i cant levave the CP. 
Clarity is that now i give equal importance to Dev as well as CP "PRACTICALLY". On cold mornings i do CP and mild, balanced afternoons i do Dev. Now i have that 45 days of training period left for my strongerhood.

>If i do only CP than i have burnout with CP and overdo it so nothing progress shows to me. If i do only Dev which is relatively easier i feel that Dev is so easy that i get a ton of free time and my path for learing dev get deviated to learning linux, internal tools etc which is a nice thing but time has not come for this thing. So Dev and CP is quite a nice combination to persue.
1. If i feel exhausted from CP, exhausted from its nature of never showing result than i Jump to Dev in afternoons for its result showing nature.
CP and Dev's intresting fusion help me in Long run CP for my analytical skills in programming and dev in my practical skills in programming.




27/12
	I think that god has released me from all sins, all my sorrow, all my regrets, all my fears(for coding it has to be decided by today's evening) and he also put me away from the hell which was created by me for past 3 years.
	Yesterday, i see the kitchen construction of chachi. Then i thought "how much money is needed until my wedding(just a milestone remark) which will be in next 5-6 years?" Than i do some caluculations and figure out that it requires approx 10 lac Rs(6 lac for home and 4 lac for shop) in 4 years. And i call this expense as "1 phase kharcha" in future. for me to be a eligible candidate for my wedding. For this i caluculated how much my starting salary should be? Surprisingly this comes to approx 30k starting salary which was not so difficult task for me. Because as 30k starting salaryi can save 18k easily everymonth for my 1st phase kharcha.
. 


PHASE1:(GOOD LIFE req15lac)-------
->SAVINGS:
MAIN SOURCE OF SAVING IS INDIAN LOW SALARIES
2023:
18k*12 = 2.1 lac as my 1st year earning
tenure savings: 2.1lac

2024:
23k*12 = 2.7 lac as my 2nd year earnings
tenure savings: 4.8lac

2025:
Than after 3 years of studying DSALGO and 2 years of experience in my pocket i can become an FAANGy
case 1:					case 2:
i become the FAANGy			I not become FAANGy this time
salary : 85k				salary: 50k
saving ; 60k*12=7.2lac			savings: 28k*12 = 3.3 lac
tenure savings: 12 lac			tenure savings: 8.1 lac

2026:
Than after 4 years, as a FAANGY i become mid level engineer and salary +=5lac. Wherease in Case 2 i must become a faangy after 4 years of DSALGO
case 1:					case 2:
FAANGy mid level			FAANGy starting
salry: 1 lac				salary : 85k
savings : 70k*12 = 8.4lac		saving ; 60k*12=7.2lac		
tenure savings : 20.4 lac		tenure savings: 15.3lac



->EXPENSE/year:
base expense per month
10k: 6k(PG), 4k(daily Commute).
2k: commute to home
 
expense per year: 1.4lac(starting)
every year +60k to expense



-->CONCLUSION:
So at age 27 i have AT_MIN : 15 lac
		    AT_MAX : 20 lac
AT_MIN-phase1 :-
My-savings: OK(15lac)
Home-construction: OK(-8lac)
Buisness-expense(shop): OK(-7lac)
Marriage-expene: OK(-4lac)
Shop-savings: OK(+4lac)
(15+4)-(8+7+4)=19-19=0
AT_MIN everything went OK if i work hard on DSALGO and DEV without any fear of failure
NOTE:Bank_Balance_Become_zero_after_phase_1

AT_MAX-phase1 :-
*My-savings: EXCELEN(20lac)
Home-construction: OK(-8lac)
*Buisness-expense(shop): EXCLENT(-10lac)
Marriage-expene: OK(-4lac)
*Shop-savings: OK(+5lac)
(20+5)-(8+10+4)=25-22=3
AT_MAX everything went *EXCELENT if i work hard on DSALGO and DEV without any fear of failure
NOTE:I have some bankBalance left
********I HAVE SOME STOCKS OF 2 YEAR VESTING PERIOD***********************

2. youTube p music, insp and study k alaava koi idhar udhar ki vdo nahi. e.g news, food, science ki karamatein etc...

9. nishkaam karam, padho aise ki jaise bhagwaan ki pooja kar re ho, aur y baat sach b h Qki har cheez bhagwaan dwaare rachit khel hi to h.
10.Salary Progression: 
 	Avg 40k i.e 5LPA starting
	So, 28k*12 = 3.3 lac
	2nd year may be 8LPA salary
	So, 40k*12 = 5 lac
	3rd yeat join FAANG
	So, 7.3 lac
	After 3 yeats = 16lac..
11. tumhara aage ka soch liya h (above salary progression), pichle ka bhi soch liya h(past regrets), in sab ka ek hi marz h, DEV+DSALGO bass.. abhi 25 k hone tak tumhe iske alaava kisi or cheez k baare m nahi sochna h

13.38 p mera YouTube channel khulega OK


2/1/21 
	Today i change my ambitions little more.
As we see, my 2 year net income be around 6 lac. Previously i saved that money. But Now i decided to invest that money, not in house, not in shop construction, But in Kamla Gift and Garments Shop.

After In 2025, 2 years of starting salary i have around 7lac Rs. in my hand which i spent on,
->shop fitting.(2lac)
->samaan : gifts and toys + garments (5lac)
SALARY EXPECTATION: 28k(1) & 38k(2)  8lac floor() = 7lac
=> at the age of 26 and in 2025 i have,
-> A well designed, settled gift and garments shop. 
-> Well planed being of Mom with that boy named anku.
#this expense called "AARAMBH" jo hoga prachand

Than after next two years of savings i have total around 12lac of savings, which i spent on:
->house (7lac)
->gaadi (4lac) downpayment
->shaadi (4lac)
SALARY EXPECTATION: 50k(3)+60k(4) = 13lac floor() = 12lac+4lac(RD) 
=>at the age of 28 
->i have well settled buisness(MAKING DAD PROUD)
->great house
->gaadi
->healthy mummy
->wife
#this expense is called "MAN COST" which can be very high.

Than after next two year of savings i have total around 8lac of savings, which i spent on:
->kiray waali dukaan rebuilt (4lac)
->joining both (2lac) 
->saman in dukaan (7lac)
SALARY EXPECTATION: 60k(5) + 70k(6) = 16lac floor() = 13lac 
=>at the age of 30 
->i have two monster shops joint(MAKING BOTH DAD PROUD)
->giangantic buisness in both shops bcoz of rabb di mer
->a plan to execute on 2nd shop.
#this expense is called "UNITY" which is one of my core dreams.


Than after next 8 years (4 from USA) i have in total 3Cr worth of stocks, estimated min value : 3Cr(stocks) + 2Cr(salary)  which i spend on:
-> land (5Cr atleast)
-> house(25lac)
i must have 1Cr(i hand) + 5Cr(land) + 1Cr(making transition) = 7Cr atleast.
=> at the end of this huge chaos, i go to study vedant and aim for shanti at age of 38 



Expenses:
-> buisness setup (AARAMBH) 6lac on 25
-> home,gaadi,shaadi (COST FOR MAN) 15lac on 27
-> joint shops with maal (UNITY OF SHOPS) 13lac on 29
-> rest is (DREAM) 2Cr on 36-40



huoghhhh....
U know all these things are given to you only by one thing on the base which is called "codding". So now you tell me why to not take "learning codding" as my god's puja.

Aur rishav bhai ki salary dekh k to lag ra h y dev m avg efforts se hi aa jaayega.
Apne efforts jyaada rakhunda DSA m, Dev m avg efforts daalunga

7/1 
	sometimes i find it overwhelming to learn react, i found it so confusing thta is because i am doing 5 days of learning in asingle day. Today i open my that rough notebook for finding what i plan for next month there i see i started from 22nd dec and now on 7th of jan after roughly 15 days of learning react i completed Burger App starting, Http req via axios, firebase, SPA routing form validations, redux basics, redux advanced total 6 modules in 15 days 2 days for each module (for learnig as well as applying to project) which is also overwhelming... So after the learning phase of react i.e on 10th of Jan i divide my time accordingly for Dev as well as DsAlgo.

10/1 
	Around 2 days back i completed my react project by that course and until today afternoon i totally get demotivated because yesterday i call rishav and he said that css is the important thing to get a job like him. He said that "i somewhere get that job because of css and there is no substitute to css". This demotivates me like hell for past 1 day but tody i see that RD slips of our there i ses that in 2024 we get in total of 4 RDs..
2022:3000
2023:1500
2024:3000+3000+500_1500
if i not debit a single amount from all RDs until 2024 than 
2022->3000:2lac+1lac(2023&24 ammount)
2023->1500:1la
2024->3000:2lac+3000:2lac+1500:1lac
total:3lac(22) + 1lac(23) + 5lac(24): 9lac
if i go on job at 2022 and work for around 2 years than i estimated my savings :4lac(min_scale)
total money i have on 2024 july:-9+4:13lac(min_from_mine)
wooohhhooo at 25 i able to set up a good buisness of around 8lac of investment!!!!
left 5 lac i spent on 1lac->manju, 1lac->Mama?karz (my mama passes on oct 2021)
left 3 lac on gaadi....
Now i can freely work on my skills...Thanks to God


13/1 
	Everything is sort out itself by doing nothing... But for this plan to work we need to wait 3.5 years. During this time i mainly have two responsibilities.

I make some promise to myself.
Career: Saare plans ban gaye hein. Hame bass ab execution ki zaroorat hai aur execution k time to Career k baare m bilkul mat sochna sirf or sirf execution hi h career m ab baaki.
Buisness: maanta hu thoda zaroori hai sochna par 3 saal k baad ki cheez k baare m abhi se hi sochna galat hai abhi socho to bass delhi se current shop k liye maal laane ki iski shuruaat hogi March m gift items and toys laane se ferr uske baad kabhi june,july m manyaari laane k liye chala jaaunga or ferr iss baar to rakhi delhi se hi aayegi. Nov m to waise hi RD nikalegi koshish karna ki wo RD saari saaman laane me lage.
Maa ki seva karna, unki care karna, QKi 3 saal mere saath unhe bhi utna hi pashchataap karna hai jitna mujhe or bass ferr 3 saal baad 9 lac nikalenge m b atleast 5 lac to kama hi lunga 2 saal m ferr wo saara paisa dukaan m laga denge...



14/1 to 14/2 GREAT GRIEF
	I am little upset because all the main things which i wrote were lost. This is the most important and crucial time of my life and i just lost it. Anyway breif of the story is given as follow:
Initially in feb me and anubav agree that we have to come togeather to achieve something in my life. I am learning React that time.I tought him also about React. We are building our stone paper scisor app. We got stuck on a firebse fuction, we are stuck to the extent where anubhav realise that we have to be togeather for this. He does the same.At that time Rodi mama came to distribute the wedding cards to everyone he choose me with my bike for transportation.
Anbhav came to my house and we starting to plan the our doings for future. His plans are to stay at my home but not of leaving the CU. I drew a chart describing time we have and things we want to achieve is not aligning properly we are short on time and if we want to increase the time we have we want him to be migrated to CPU So we went in next bus to delhi. I remember that was very cold jorney. We arrive at anubhav's home everything went good his father also agreed for migration.
But then i dont know what happend they suddenly disagrees with our decision. It felt like we both try to make a glitch in God's algoritm and we succeed but suddenly god realizes it and he roll back all of our changes in the algorithm.

Then anubhav came back with me, pick up all his clothes and went back to delhi. Then anubhav dissapears. I was at great depression. I remember that i start weaping in the metro and call Rishav bhai at the time of returning back to home from delhi because of sadness and greive that we are not going to be togeather and none big thing going to happen in our life.

14/2 to 20/3 LIFE BECOME HELL
	Actual hell i am facing in that time. Ashok's launda also got a govt job. Me and anubhav are not going to be togeather that means I am not going to make any money in my life. All these things make my fell like I am in hell.
The stretching in the throat we feel when we are stopping our weap forcefully, i feel that all day long. My appetitie is fully gone. My mother and i are always weaping. I weap each day to lower my depression with my mother.
  
21/3 THE NURTURELABS
	Rishav suggests me that i have gained enough knowledge in Front end now i must start applying for the internships. So i applied to several internships. I was quite afraid that why someone choose me. What i have done so that someone choose me over someone else. I applied on sunday. I got 0 replies on sunday.
I told to myself that it is sunday. Everyone is on holiday on sunday. Next day 1-2 replies. Day after that 3-4 replies. First two internships are fraud. One of them take a full day of mine to complete the assignment.
Than at next sunday i went to Mama's house for  relief. And there i got internship of Rahul Bajaj.
Than after 2 days i got assignment of Nurturelabs I submitted on same day. They call me for interview and i passed it and got that internship at Nurturelabs which changed my life forever.

21/3 to 17/10
	Seven months passed. Cozmo, Tepey, WWJZD, Buffer are some contributions that i made. Now my salary is 30k, next month it becomes 42k. All money goes to my monthly savings.
rney is full of up and downs and adventours. My bank balance is 78k and upto time of graduation it may reach 78+30+42+42+42+42+50+50+50+50 = 4.5lac.	

	My family income
Year - Mine     Shop        total 
21 - 1.5          _          1.5
22 - 5           2.2         7.2
23 - 5            1           6
24 - 6           5.5         11.5
-----------------------------------
       TOTAL: 26.2lac

"26lac at age of 25" wooooo... thats a huge amount. It means atleast i get full financial freedome when i am at my mid 20s.
There is only one potential threat for this to be h	appen. Nurturelabs stop nurturing me and throw myself out. For ensuring that this is not going to be hapen is learning blockchain. So plan
is to learn blockchain today and keep my place strong in nurturelabs.

Plan for future (timahi based)
1z - Blockchain + Schedule
2a - DSA
 

I have achieved a normal satisfactory life but to make it to hills i have to go to faang.
Plan is to make a strong place in nurturelabs in 2021 and to faang in 2022.


24/10  
	"For brighter warmer flame, fuel have to be burned very hard". I have to burn all my comforts, all joys, all enjoyments in the fire to accumulate a brightest flame in the world.
This is the list of the things which gave me joy but I have to burn/suspend them to the time when I get my goal, the hills. A house on hills
1. Farming
2. Trips
3. Rests
4. Happiness
5. Love

1 because, no land can grow my food except hill soil.'
2 because trips have great joy only when they are done, but have great suffering when they passed away. The sorrow of the fact that now i am back to my life which has suffering, sorrow, pain of unachieved dreams.
3 because nothing is like rest in this situation. When i try to rest, My mind always thinking of what went wrong, what can go wrong, why i am resting, there is nothing like rest in my rests.
4 because this happiness is fake. This happiness is very shorlive. When i try to enjoy this happiness than suddenly i find that this happiness i over and great sorrow has buegun.
5 love is only a breakage in my dream now. After my dream i can go for love.

	-> Anubhav finally said "NO". And i am not waiting for him from now. And i am not going to think about this from now.
	-> One thing for sure, giving anybody charge of my life is the biggest nonsense thing I've done with myself.
	-> Long jorney ahead. The DSA, the Dev(job) everything i have to manage. For this i have to commit myself with work. For this i have to gone through sleepless nights and early mornings.
	-> I must have told anubhav to not to touch my dreams ever, ever again. I've gave him all the controls and he everytime breaks my little ambitions, my little set of dreams.

Ferr se sab kuch fail ho gaya kuch bhi execute nahi hua. Execution ko Plan karna bekaar practice hai atleast mere liye. Ab se m seedha execution p jaaunga. Also meine ek cheez realize ki, Kee mei kaafi fantasise karta hu retirement life abhi se hi, ki dukaan hogi badi, pahad p ghar hoga and all. Y sab theek h par sirf ocassionally 2-3 mahine m ek baar soch liya. Abhi utla h roz m retirement ke baare m soch raha hu or kaam actually 2-3 mahine m ek baar ho raha hai. Retirement k baare m abhi se plan karna is a bullshit thing which i was doing. I have to stop it.
	-> Retirement age must be > 40. Money > 2Cr is reality.
	-> I am young. I am in my 20s, 30s it must be phase of great efforts. Not the age of plaining retirement.
	-> It must be saving for retirement, not the plans of retirement. Because god knows what i will become in next 10-20 years than what is the point of 
thinking and plaining of retirement.
	-> I will invest all my money in index funds in starting not in the money not in buying temprory happiness. It will be just investment.
	=> These small things will take all my energy & time.Plaining of Waking up, Practicing DSA, Knowing about crypto all fail. Now it is only execurtion & No planning at all. Planning will happen only when I am on the track.
	=>"All plains which involves fantasising are bullshit".
